A demo of a working toy example of the pattern in Greenfoot to go over in class.
A demo in c#/unity (our platform for the course) to be shared with your classmates (exported as an asset)
A uml diagram of your Greenfoot example
A uml diagram of your Unity example
Lead a discussion about when the pattern would be appropriate.
What are some common implementation variations?
Any other considerations that seem appropriate or important about the pattern that you think would be good to share.
A small quiz for the class that you will also grade. (Note: don’t aim for difficult at this stage! This class is introductory, so think “exposure” and “basic retention” instead of “mastery”)
A list of the other design patterns you've used in your project (please have at least 4 for full credit, and up to 5 more for up to 10 extra credit (capped at 100))
Your powerpoint, your exported games, and your quiz (after it has been given to the class) will all be shared with both sections of the class through google drive, so that everyone will have what you developed for their own study in future years!

Grading will be in the following manner:

 

Grade is 60% about how you do at your lesson
20% about how folks do at YOUR lesson, as evidenced by the quiz!
20% how you do at all of the other lessons, as evidenced by those quizzes!
20% Good information / presentation
20% Includes all of the necessary elements
20% Game asset (including cleanliness of the code for the pattern that you are actually modeling)
